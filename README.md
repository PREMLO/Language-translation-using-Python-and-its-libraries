# Language-translation-using-Python-and-its-libraries
This Python script uses Tkinter to create a desktop application for translating English text into Hindi, French, and German. Leveraging the `googletrans` library, it provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text and select a target language from a dropdown menu. Upon clicking the "Translate" button, the application displays the translated text in a dedicated area. The GUI features improved styling with fonts and padding for an enhanced user experience. The application ensures that the entire translated text is displayed without cutting off any lines, making it an efficient tool for quick language translation tasks.
